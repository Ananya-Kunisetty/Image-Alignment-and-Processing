Quantified and analyzed Correlation Coefficient and QMI between a magnetic resonance image capturing a portion
of the human brain and a modified version obtained by pixel shifting, yielding valuable insights into image analysis
Followed a functional programming approach to develop functions in MATLAB and calculate the QMI measure
